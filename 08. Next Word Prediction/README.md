# Next Word Prediction

The next word prediction is a task of predicting the most probable next word in a sequence given some context words. This can be achieved by training a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) on a large corpus of text data. The RNN is a type of neural network that is capable of processing sequential data by maintaining a hidden state that captures the context of the sequence up to the current time step.



## Objective
The objective of this project is to train a RNN using Tensorflow and Keras library on a large corpus of text data and use it to predict the most probable next word in a given context.



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project can be accessed through this link: 

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GeUzNVqiixXHnTl8oNiQ2W3CynX_lsu2/view. 

It is a text file that contains a large corpus of text data that can be used for training the RNN.


## Approach
The approach used in this project involves the following steps:

1. Loading and preprocessing the text data

2. Tokenizing the text data into sequences of fixed length

3. Creating training and validation sets

4. Building the RNN model using Tensorflow and Keras

5. Training the model on the training set

6. Evaluating the model on the validation set

7. Generating next word predictions using the trained model



## Results
The results of this project will be a RNN model that is capable of predicting the most probable next word in a given context. The performance of the model will be evaluated on the validation set and the accuracy of the predictions will be reported.



## Conclusion
The next word prediction is an interesting task that can be achieved by training a RNN on a large corpus of text data. This project aims to build a RNN model using Tensorflow and Keras that can predict the most probable next word in a given context. The accuracy of the model will be evaluated on a validation set and the performance will be reported.
