# Handwritten Equation Solver Using CNN

This project involves building a mathematical equation solver using character and symbol recognition based on image processing and CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) techniques. The dataset used for this project is the "Handwritten Math Symbols" dataset available on Kaggle, which contains handwritten images of various mathematical symbols.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Handwritten Math Symbols" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains a total of 98,000 handwritten images of various mathematical symbols such as numbers, operators, and functions, each in grayscale format.

## Approach
The first step in this project is to preprocess the dataset by converting the images to a suitable format and normalizing them. Then, a CNN model is trained on this preprocessed data to recognize the mathematical symbols present in the input image. Once the symbols are recognized, they are then combined to form the complete mathematical equation, which is then solved using Python libraries.

## Results
The final output of this project is a system that can recognize and solve handwritten mathematical equations. The accuracy of the system depends on the accuracy of the trained CNN model and the quality of the input image.

## Conclusion
The Handwritten Equation Solver using CNN is an exciting application of image processing and deep learning techniques. It can be used in various fields where mathematical equations need to be solved quickly and efficiently. However, there is still scope for improvement in terms of accuracy and speed, which can be achieved by using more advanced CNN models and improving the preprocessing techniques.
