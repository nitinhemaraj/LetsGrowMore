# ML Facial Recognition To Detect Mood And Suggest Songs Accordingly

## Overview
This machine learning project involves building a facial recognition system that can detect the mood of a person and suggest songs based on their emotions. The dataset used in this project is called FER2013, which consists of facial images of people along with the emotion expressed in the image.

## Dataset
The FER2013 dataset is available on Kaggle and contains 35,887 grayscale images of faces with 48x48 pixels, each labeled with one of seven emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral.

## Approach
The approach involves using deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to train a model to recognize the emotions expressed in the facial images. Once the emotion is identified, a recommendation system can suggest songs based on the user's mood.

## Results
The results of this project would be a facial recognition system that can accurately detect the mood of a person and suggest songs based on their emotions.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project is an interesting application of machine learning, as it involves not only image recognition but also the use of music recommendations based on mood detection. It could have several real-world applications, such as in music streaming platforms, where it can suggest personalized playlists based on a user's mood.
