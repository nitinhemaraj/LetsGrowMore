# Prediction using Decision Tree  Algorithm 


## Overview
Decision Tree Algorithm is a popular and widely used algorithm in Machine Learning for classification and prediction tasks. The aim of this project is to create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose of this classifier is to predict the right class for new data fed to it.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Iris Dataset, which is a popular dataset among Machine Learning enthusiasts. The dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and 3 classes (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica).

## Approach
The project involves the following approach:

1. Loading the dataset using pandas
2. Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
3. Creating a Decision Tree classifier using scikit-learn
4. Training the classifier using the training set
5. Visualizing the classifier using graphviz and matplotlib
6. Predicting the class for new data fed to the classifier



## Results
The Decision Tree classifier created in this project can accurately predict the class of new data fed to it. The accuracy of the classifier can be evaluated using various metrics like confusion matrix, classification report, etc.



## Conclusion
The Decision Tree Algorithm is a powerful and widely used algorithm in Machine Learning for classification and prediction tasks. It is a simple and easy-to-understand algorithm that can handle both categorical and numerical data. In this project, we learned how to create a Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically using scikit-learn, graphviz, and matplotlib. We also saw how the classifier can accurately predict the class of new data fed to it.
