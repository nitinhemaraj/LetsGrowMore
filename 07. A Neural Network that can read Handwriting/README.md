# A Neural Network That Can Read Handwriting:

The MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification Challenge is a well-known project that uses neural networks to classify images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. In this project, we use TensorFlow and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train a model that can recognize handwritten digits accurately.


## Dataset
The MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, with 60,000 images used for training and 10,000 for testing. The images are grayscale and have a size of 28x28 pixels. Each pixel is represented by a value between 0 and 255, indicating the intensity of the pixel.

Dataset can be seen on MNIST or can click on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database . 


## Approach
In this project, we use a CNN to classify the images of handwritten digits. The CNN consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. We use the TensorFlow framework to build and train the model.

We first load the dataset, preprocess it by normalizing the pixel values, and split it into training and testing sets. Then, we build the CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers. We compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and metrics.

Next, we train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set. We also use techniques like early stopping and model checkpointing to avoid overfitting and save the best model.

Finally, we use the trained model to predict the classes of new images of handwritten digits.


## Results
After training the CNN model on the MNIST dataset, we achieve a high accuracy of over 99% on the testing set. This indicates that the model is able to accurately classify handwritten digits.


## Conclusion
In this project, we successfully built a CNN model using TensorFlow that can recognize handwritten digits accurately. This project is a good starting point for beginners who are interested in neural network machine learning projects.
